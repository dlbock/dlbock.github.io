When I first encountered the term “Staff Engineer” about 5 years ago, I was struck by how little guidance, direction and documentation were available about the role and its expectations. However, eventually I found Will Larson’s website and his insightful [interviews](https://staffeng.com/stories/) with various senior technical folks in the industry. Eventually he published his book [“Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track”](https://staffeng.com/book/) in 2021. Then I came across Tanya Reilly and her blog post entitled [“Being Glue”](https://noidea.dog/glue) and felt like someone was finally helping me put words to the things I cared about professionally.

The Staff+ Engineer community has since experienced tremendous growth, and the current challenge lies in finding the suitable resources and support that align with your specific goals.

**Disclaimer**: By no means am I saying that I am an expert & know what I’m doing just because I’ve read some books or listened to some podcasts/webinars.

I will share the resources I’ve used and how they’ve helped me so far:

- Will Larson’s book [“Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track”](https://staffeng.com/book/) helped me put some structure around what a Staff Engineer should be doing and thinking about and to read stories from real people in the industry.

- Tanya Reilly’s blog post on [“Being Glue”](https://noidea.dog/glue) and her writing in general really resonated with me. Her book [“The Staff Engineer’s Path”](https://noidea.dog/staff)  dives deeper into the various parts of a Staff+ Engineer’s journey to discuss the responsibilities and expectations of the role, what good looks like and how to chart one’s way forward.

- The [LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/) community organizes [free webinars](https://leaddev.com/events) on various topics on leadership. They also have a Slack channel dedicated to the `#staffplus` topic on the [LeadDev Slack org](https://leaddev.com/human-centered-technical-community) not to mention an [entire conference series](https://leaddev.com/staffplus-new-york). 

  - Some of the webinars I've enjoyed:
    - [How to become a staff+ engineer](https://leaddev.com/staffplus/how-become-staff-engineer)
    - [Essential soft skills you need to succeed as an engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8i7IHBqIzY)
    - [An engineering leader’s guide to reporting up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb5dNdQuLPo)

  - The [LeadDev YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LeadDev) is a great treasure trove of past talk recordings, and [this playlist of StaffPlus Broadcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBzScQzZ83I9vQCDNnz1pGpXsLxMuYtBo) is particularly great.

- Other people whose writing I enjoy and have learned/are continuously learning a lot from:
  - [Charity Majors](https://charity.wtf/2024/01/05/questionable-advice-my-boss-says-we-dont-need-any-engineering-managers-is-he-right/)
  - [Emily Nakashima](https://honkathon.com/2023-07-11-becoming-a-vp-engineering-part-1/)
  - [Lara Hogan](https://larahogan.me/blog/find-a-buddy-team-of-one/)
  - [Camille Fournier](https://www.elidedbranches.com/2023/07/the-next-larger-context.html)
  - [Pat Kua](https://www.patkua.com/about/) and his free [LevelUp newsletter](https://levelup.patkua.com/)


Here’s hoping that this list is helps someone in their growth journey, wherever they might be.
