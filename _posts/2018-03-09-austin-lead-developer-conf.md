What makes a good technical leader? How does one stay competent technically while being an effective leader? How do we build more effective teams in the age where people are constantly pulled in multiple directions but still expected to focus and deliver?

I had the privilege of attending The Lead Developer Conference held for the first time in Austin this year. There were a lot of good talks but here is a snippet of the ones that stuck with me.

* **[Pat Kua: Levelling Up: The Way of the Lead Developer](https://www.slideshare.net/thekua/levelling-up-the-way-of-the-lead-developer)**

  - As engineers, our default mode is the 'maker' mode. But, as a leader, we don't necessarily need to always be the one solving the problem, instead, enable the team to do so themselves.
  - There rarely is only one right answer to a problem, especially when it involves human beings. Consider the context of the situation and the tradeoffs when making decisions.
  - What you say matters as much as how you say it. Each of us come with different interpretations of reality and our own personal biases, so what you say could mean different things to different people.


* **Julia Grace: Building Engineering Teams Under Pressure**

  - [When Google set out on its quest to build the perfect team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html), the most important thing they found after studying many many teams was that the good ones generally shared 2 behaviors: Members spoke in roughly the same proportion (equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking) and they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on nonverbal cues (high "average social sensitivity"). __Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety__
  - Toxic conflict arises when different people are solving different problems that they think are the same problem.
  - Get as much clarity and information as possible about the problems that you're solving and NOT solving.
  - Grace further illustrates the combination psychological safety and clarity:

                Psychological
                    safety

* **Heidi Waterhouse: The Death of Data: Retention, Rot, and Risk**

  - Be mindful of the data that you store. Store it in such a way that enables you to separate the wheat from the chaff.
  - It might be cheap to store data, but is it cheap to maintain, protect and convert to new formats in the future?
  - Old data is not neutral, it affects current data.
  - "Collect carefully. Ingest mindfully. Delete boldly."
