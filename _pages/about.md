I started my software engineering career at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) (2006-2013), where I met many people whom I still look up to, and where I formed the foundation of my skills and learned the pragmatism of software development.

I also spent some time at [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) (2014-2016) which exposed me to problems at scale and the importance of achieving as much as possible with limited resources.

I'm currently at [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/) after recently moving from New York City to Austin, TX.
