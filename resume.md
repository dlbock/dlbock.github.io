## Summary

I am a seasoned polyglot backend engineer with experience in full-stack and mobile development. I value team collaboration over individuality. I value maintainable, tested, well-documented, and working code over just any kind of code. Iâ€™m good at picking up new languages and tools, mastering whatever is needed to get the job done effectively.
