I started my software engineering career at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) (2006-2013), where I formed the foundation of my skills and learned the pragmatism of software development. I also spent some time at [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) (2014-2016) which exposed me to problems at scale and the importance of achieving the most with very limited resources.

I started programming in Java but since then I have worked across multiple tech stacks and in multiple domains. I'm comfortable picking up and learning new things.
