I started my software career at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) (2006-2013) where I met many people whom I still look up to, and where I formed the foundation of my skills and learned the pragmatism of software development.

I also spent some time at [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com) (2014-2016) which exposed me to problems at scale and the importance of monitoring your software and achieving as much as possible with limited resources.

I'm currently at [Instana](https://www.instana.com/) and based in Austin, TX.

More information can be found on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dahliabock/).
