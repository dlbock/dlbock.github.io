I started my software engineering career at [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com), then followed by a short stint at [Intent Media](https://www.intentmedia.com), and most recently I was at [SoundCloud](https://www.soundcloud.com).

Though my most recent experience have been doing backend work in Ruby, Scala and some Clojure, I have worked across multiple tech stacks and in multiple domains. I'm comfortable picking up and learning new things.
